# Independent Parallel Particle Layer (IPPL)

IPPL represents the backend of OPAL implementing particles, meshes and operations on them to do PIC codes. This repository serves
as a temporary development environment decoupled from OPAL in order to enhance the backend with the performance portable capabilities
of [Kokkos](https://github.com/kokkos).

For installation, please see the [wiki](https://gitlab.psi.ch/frey_m/ippl/-/wikis/developer-info/Compile-IPPL).
